=============
Making civicrm work with Drupal Views module [is pain](https://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Views3+Integration),
you also need to keep updating the drupal settings.php file each time a new table by and extension or
new custom group get added .

This Extension simplifies this operation by updating the setting.php file with all CiviCRM tables prefixes when installed
and keep an eye on any custom group get added and append it to the setting.php file automaticly 
without any user interaction.
